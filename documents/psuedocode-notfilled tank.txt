if not full
	set notfull indicator on totals table
	update all except mpg (perhaps in MPG field say Not Full)
	set notfull indicator on gas details table
	write all records


if full
	if notfull indicator on totals table is set
		gather total miles and total gallons from gas detail records that have notfull indicator on
		calculate mpg seperately with new totals
		unset notfull indicator on totals table
		write all records
		
		
		
1. How prevent duplicate records with same odometer reading	
2. Need edit screen for updating gas capture
3. Need rebalance code to recalculate all entrys based on date and odometer
4. How prevent odometer entry that is less then current in capture	



how calc gas tank filled

select * 
from gastripentrytbl
where memberid = 1 and tripid = 5 
order by date desc 

while (get next record)
{
	if notfull indicator detail is set
		add miles to miles
		add gallons to gallons
	else
		break out of loop
}
